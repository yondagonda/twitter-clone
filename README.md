## Motivations
My main motivation for starting this project was wanting to gain experience on building a fullstack project, and proving that I could copy a design close to 1-to-1. Up to now I had only worked on front-end only websites that didnt utilise any backend of sorts, so I figured creating a clone of a social media site like Twitter would not only be something new for myself, but also an overall good learning experience. Additionally, I wanted to gain some familiarity with using Next.js and its features, while also using TypeScript for the first time.

## Showcase
The following are some showcase images of the clone.

## Features
- **Authentic Twitter-like design**: Mostly close replication of the design and layout of Twitter ensures a familiar and immersive user experience. 
- **User authentications**: Utilizes Firebase authentication to provide secure login functionality. Users can create and authenticate with their Google account to access the clone's features.
- **Backend powered by Firestore**: Store and retrieve user data, tweets, and other related information. This allows for efficient data management and real-time updates.
- **Demo account functionality**: To provide a quick way to explore the clone without the need for sign-up, a demo account feature is available.
- **Profile pages**: Users can visit other users' profile pages to view their tweets, followers, following, and other profile information. Additionally, users have the ability to edit their own profile information.

## Technologies 
- Firebase Services
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- Framer Motion

## What I learnt:
- How to incorporate and utilize a backend infrastructure to handle data storage, retrieval, and other server-side operations.
- Enhanced my understanding of asynchronous programming through the extensive use of backend API calls I had to setup for this project to work.
- Learned how TypeScript catches potential errors during development by providing type checking and better code quality.
- Through Next.js, learned how to create more dynamic and efficient functional page routes, enhancing the overall performance and user experience of the site.
- Improved and refined my CSS skills through having to replicate complex designs accurately.
